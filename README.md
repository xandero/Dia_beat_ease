<h3>Database</h3>

ActiveRecord and Postgres are used to manage the database. If you would like to setup your own instance of the site, use 'rake' to create and migrate the database.

<h3>Primary Functionality</h3>

Users have the ability to upload data from their digital blood sugar monitor, and review this data in chart format.

The site also provides information on the carbohydrate content for more than 300,000 food items. A calculator also produces an estimate of the amount of insulin required to offset the carbohydrates in a meal, based on the user's input of foods that comprise the meal.

Registered users are sent daily weather updates via email, with details on any significant temperature changes that are forecast over the coming week. The location for the forecast will be the location from where the user last logged into the site.

<h3>Bugs</h3>

Currently, we are unaware of any bugs in the code. If you happen to stumble across a bug or fault, please contact us via github.

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.
